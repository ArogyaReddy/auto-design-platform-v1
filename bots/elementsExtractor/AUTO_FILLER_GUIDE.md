## Troubleshooting

### **Auto-Fill Not Working**
1. Ensure the page has loaded completely
2. Check if fields are visible on screen
3. Try refreshing the page and retrying
4. Enable test mode for safer operation

### **Elements Not Being Detected**
1. The element might be in a Shadow DOM
2. Field might have unusual naming conventions
3. Element might be dynamically loaded
4. Check browser console for error messages

### **Interactions Failing**
1. Enable test mode for safer interactions
2. Ensure elements are clickable and visible
3. Check if page has strict security policies
4. Try on a simpler test page first

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Chromium (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge
- ‚úÖ Brave Browser
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Firefox (Limited support)
- ‚ùå Safari (Not supported)

## Best Practices

1. **Always use Test Mode** when first trying on a new site
2. **Review the logs** to understand what actions were performed
3. **Test on simple pages first** before complex applications
4. **Check form validation** after auto-filling
5. **Use responsibly** and respect website terms of service

## Tips & Tricks

### **For Developers**
- Use data attributes (`data-testid`) for more reliable detection
- Follow semantic HTML practices for better auto-detection
- Use ARIA labels for accessibility and auto-filler compatibility

### **For Testers**
- Combine with Element Inspector for comprehensive testing
- Use Test Mode to safely explore functionality
- Check the logs to verify expected behavior
