KrismithReddy12: let's push all of the code to new repo 
git remote add origin https://github.com/ArogyaReddy/auto-design-platform-v1.git

Give me the git commands and so I will execute myself

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you push your code to the new repository. Let me first check the current git status and then provide you with the complete sequence of git commands. 

KrismithReddy12: Every time you try this command :
cd /Users/arog/ADP/ElementsExtractorV1 && git branch -a

You are stuck with the below :
  remotes/origin/playwright-utility-plus-1
~
~
~
~
~
~
(END)

Why so?

GitHub Copilot: The issue you're experiencing is that the `git branch -a` command is using a pager (likely `less`) to display the output, and you're stuck in the pager view. The `(END)` at the bottom and the `~` symbols indicate you're in the `less` pager.

Here are the ways to exit and avoid this issue:

## To exit the current pager:
- Press `q` to quit the pager and return to your terminal

## To avoid this issue in the future, use one of these approaches:

### Option 1: Disable pager for this command
```bash
cd /Users/arog/ADP/ElementsExtractorV1 && git --no-pager branch -a
```

### Option 2: Pipe to cat to prevent paging
```bash
cd /Users/arog/ADP/ElementsExtractorV1 && git branch -a | cat
```

### Option 3: Set git to not use pager for branch commands globally
```bash
git config --global pager.branch false
```

### Option 4: Use a shorter command that's less likely to trigger paging
```bash
cd /Users/arog/ADP/ElementsExtractorV1 && git branch -r
```
(This shows only remote branches, which might be shorter)

The reason this happens is that Git automatically uses a pager when the output is longer than your terminal height. Since you have multiple remote branches, the output triggers the pager. The `--no-pager` flag or piping to `cat` prevents this behavior.

For now, just press `q` to exit the pager, then use one of the alternative commands above.

Give me the git commands and so I will execute myself

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you push all your code to the new repository. Let me first check the current git status to understand what we're working with, then provide you with the complete sequence of commands. Perfect! Now I can see the current state. You have a repository with multiple branches and you want to push everything to a new repository. Here are the complete git commands you need to execute:

## Git Commands to Push to New Repository

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/arog/ADP/ElementsExtractorV1

# 2. Remove the current origin remote
git remote remove origin

# 3. Add the new repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/ArogyaReddy/auto-design-platform-v1.git

# 4. Push the main branch first (this creates the repository)
git push -u origin main

# 5. Push all other local branches to the new repository
git push origin auto-filler
git push origin best-locators
git push origin enhanced-extractor
git push origin enhanced-inspector
git push origin enhanced-inspector-plus
git push origin playwright-utility
git push origin playwright-utility-plus
git push origin playwright-utility-plus-1

# 6. Set the current branch (auto-filler) to track the new remote
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/auto-filler auto-filler

# 7. Verify the new remote is set correctly
git remote -v

# 8. Check that all branches are pushed
git branch -a
```

## Alternative: Push All Branches at Once

If you prefer to push all branches in one command, you can use:

```bash
# Steps 1-3 same as above, then:
cd /Users/arog/ADP/ElementsExtractorV1
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/ArogyaReddy/auto-design-platform-v1.git

# Push all branches at once
git push --all origin

# Set upstream for current branch
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/auto-filler auto-filler
```

## What Each Command Does:

1. **`git remote remove origin`** - Removes the current remote repository connection
2. **`git remote add origin [URL]`** - Adds your new repository as the origin
3. **`git push -u origin main`** - Pushes main branch and sets it as upstream (creates the repo on GitHub)
4. **`git push origin [branch]`** - Pushes each individual branch
5. **`git branch --set-upstream-to=...`** - Sets your current branch to track the new remote

Execute these commands one by one, and your entire codebase with all branches will be pushed to the new repository!
